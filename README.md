## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>What types of projects can I publish?</b></summary>

Any static web project can be published, including:
- Single HTML files
- Static sites (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Built output from Vite, Next.js, Astro, Nuxt, etc.
- ZIP archives containing web content
- Projects generated by AI coding agents

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I update an existing Vibe?</b></summary>

Yes! The skill automatically tracks your publish history. When you publish from the same source path, it updates the existing Vibe instead of creating a new one. Use `--new` flag to force create a new Vibe.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if my project needs to be built first?</b></summary>

The skill auto-detects buildable projects (Vite, Next.js, Astro, etc.) and prompts you to build before publishing. It supports npm, pnpm, yarn, and bun package managers.
